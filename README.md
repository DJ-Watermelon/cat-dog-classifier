# cat-dog-classifier
Adapted from implementation of cat-dog image classifiers made by [uysim](https://www.kaggle.com/code/uysimty/keras-cnn-dog-or-cat-classification/notebook#Create-Testing-Generator) and [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cat-dog-classification-using-convolutional-neural-network-in-python/). Data is taken from Kaggle's [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats) competition.

This project classifies images as either cat or dog with roughly 85% accuracy. A convolutional neural network with 3 convolution and max-pooling layers was used for the model. Normalization techniques like early stopping, batch normalization and dropout as used throughout the model.

Documentation and implementation of the classifer can be view in the [cat-dog-classifer.ipynb](https://github.com/DJ-Watermelon/cat-dog-classifier/blob/main/cat_dog_classifier.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
